For this assignment, I tried to replicate what I built in WordPress & Elementor.  It's been fun hand making it! Not had to hand make in a while [years perhaps] 😅 URL to original website - https://createxr.co.uk/

🤓 Step 1: was copying content into plain HTML

🤓 Step 2: styled the NAV - dabbled with a little flexbox (I learnt HTML & CSS way before this, won't go to far in it for this submission as I know we are learning more on this soon) - I just wanted to try it 😅 - need to make the logo smaller without being squashed - 📋 to do! 

🤓 Step 3: Create the Intro section using a background image.  Don't know how to put the video in yet, will work that out another time!



📄 Outstanding to do:

👩🏽‍💻 Sort out page alignment so content is the middle and aligns with Nav Bar (that needs sorting too)

👩🏽‍💻 Finish styling Links to blogs (will link to original website)

👩🏽‍💻 Finish doing all of the other styling bits

For this assignment I created a website that is based on learning spanish.  Later on the course I would like to attempt building an interactive resource that helps me practice Spanish everyday. And a resource that helps dyslexics learn Spanish. 

📋 I have created a seperate read.me file to go with the submission in week-2-sub folder
