# Read Me File for Week 2 assignment, Build a Multi-page Responsive Website 

## About Project
This a website that would help people with dyslexia learn spanish.  This is the first concept, creating a few pages.  Later if I can work on it more, I would like to build something that helps with remember phrases and help with conversations. 

👀 Hero/banner area - button would scroll to the next section, using smooth scrolling - hover over the cat there is a small transition effect. 
👀 Content area, hover effect also applied on the cat on the left.
👀 Blog cards also have hover effects.
👀 Pseudo-elements added to Email form.

## 👀 How to view wireframe sketches

Wireframe images to see how this all started can be found in the assets > wireframes folder.  There may be somethings that I have changed as I went along.
