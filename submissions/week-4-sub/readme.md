# Read Me File for Week 4 assignment, Creating a Todo list with Javascript

## 👀 Process
- These two websites have been helpful in creating my todo list:  https://www.codedex.io/projects/create-a-to-do-list-app-with-html-css-js & https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp 
- As I am learning Spanish, I wanted to make it spanish themed that will help me learn (and remember what I am learning 😂🤪)
