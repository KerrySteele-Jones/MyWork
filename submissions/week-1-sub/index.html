            <hr >
            <p>Iâ€™m a digital media creative specialising in UX, interaction design, prototyping, and XR (Extended Reality). My work explores how emerging technologies can create engaging, accessible, and meaningful experiences in XR environments, web, or mobile applications.  My time as a Senior Lecturer in Digital Media has provided valuable insight into how we introduce people to new technologies and help them see their potential in different fields. I saw first-hand the challenges students and staff faced when adopting immersive tools, whether due to access barriers, complex interfaces, or a lack of structured onboarding. That experience has driven my interest in creating better ways to help people learn, experiment, and confidently adopt new technology</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m particularly interested in XR onboarding, authoring tools, and prototyping methods, not just in making technology more accessible but also in empowering people to create with it. Iâ€™ve been exploring spatial computing, interfaceless design, and AI-driven co-creation, thinking about how these ideas shape learning, creativity, and user experiences. Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to experiment, collaborate, and push the boundaries of interactive and immersive technology through design research, design thinking and prototyping.</p>

            <h1>Authoring Tools</h1>
             <p>My work focuses on democratising XR authoring tools and making immersive technology more accessible to diverse users. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how empowering people to create their own XR experiences can drive innovation, education, and professional development. By developing structured resources and accessible authoring environments, I aim to lower the barriers to entry, ensuring that XR technology isnâ€™t limited to specialists but can be harnessed by anyone. This approach promotes a decentralised model of XR content creation, allowing individuals and organisations to build immersive experiences tailored to their needs. XR can transform how we learn and work, giving people hands-on ways to explore, experiment, and develop new skills. My goal is to explore how immersive technology can create opportunities for people to learn, connect, and shape the future</p>
